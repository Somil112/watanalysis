24/03/20, 1:30 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: How to dominate the world quickly?

THE GREAT CHINESE STAGE

1. Create a virus and the antidote.

2. Spread the virus.

3. A demonstration of efficiency, building hospitals in a few days. After all, you were already prepared, with the projects, ordering the equipment, hiring the labor, the water and sewage network, the prefabricated building materials and stocked in an impressive volume.

4. Cause chaos in the world, starting with Europe.

5. Quickly plaster the economy of dozens of countries.

6. Stop production lines in factories in other countries.

7. Cause stock markets to fall and buy companies at a bargain price.

8. Quickly control the epidemic in your country. After all, you were already prepared.

9. Lower the price of commodities, including the price of oil you buy on a large scale.

10. Get back to producing quickly while the world is at a standstill. Buy what you negotiated cheaply in the crisis and sell more expensive what is lacking in countries that have paralyzed their industries.

After all, you read more Confucius than Karl Marx.

*PS: Before laughing, read the book by Chinese colonels Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui, from 1999, “Unrestricted Warfare: China’s master plan to destroy America”, on Amazon, then we talk. It's all there.*

Worth pondering..
Just Think about this...

How come Russia & North Korea are totally free of Covid- 19? Because they are staunch ally of China. Not a single case reported from this 2 countries. On the other hand South Korea / United Kingdom / Italy / Spain and Asia are severely hit. How come Wuhan is suddenly free from the deadly virus?

China will say that their drastic initial measures they took was very stern and Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread to other areas. I am sure they are using the Anti dode of the virus.

Why Beijing was not hit? Why only Wuhan? Kind of interesting to ponder upon.. right? Well ..Wuhan is open for business now. America and all the above mentioned countries are devastated financially. Soon American economy will collapse as planned by China. China knows it CANNOT defeat America militarily as USA is at present

THE MOST POWERFUL country in the world. So use the virus...to cripple the economy and paralyse the nation and its Defense capabilities. I'm sure Nancy Pelosi got a part in this. . to topple Trump. Lately President Trump was always telling of how GREAT American economy was improving in all fronts. The only way to destroy his vision of making AMERICA GREAT AGAIN is to create an economic havoc. Nancy Pelosi was unable to bring down Trump thru impeachment. ....so work along with China to destroy Trump by releasing a virus. Wuhan,s epidemic was a showcase. At the peak of the virus epidemic. ..

China's President Xi Jinping...just wore a simple RM1 facemask to visit those effected areas. As President he should be covered from head to toe.....but it was not the case. He was already injected to resist any harm from the virus....that means a cure was already in place before the virus was released.

Some may ask....Bill Gates already predicted the outbreak in 2015...so the chinese agenda cannot be true. The answer is. ..YES...Bill Gates did predict. .but that prediction is based on a genuine virus outbreak. Now China is also telling that the virus was predicted well in advance. ....so that its agenda would play along well to match that prediction. China,s vision is to control the World economy by buying up stocks now from countries facing the brink of severe ECONOMIC COLLAPSE. Later China will announce that their Medical Researchers have found a cure to destroy the virus. Now China have other countries stocks in their arsenal and these countries will soon be slave to their master...CHINA.

Just Think about it ...
The Doctor Who declared this virus was also Silenced by the Chinese Authorities...

Thoughts??

27/03/20, 2:40 pm - Somil Shah: They term it as a lab mutated virus which increased the mortality rate to 90% but increased the spread drastically. Plus they made it in such a way that the vaccine is very hard to create
27/03/20, 2:40 pm - Somil Shah: Wait
27/03/20, 2:40 pm - Somil Shah: <Media omitted>
27/03/20, 2:45 pm - Vishesh Dj: That’s because coronavirus is a general term for a group of viruses and uske pehle 2 baar outbreak ho chuka hai
27/03/20, 2:47 pm - Somil Shah: Haa yeh Nisarg bola. But still the mutation and everything sparks something fishy

04/04/20, 11:44 pm - Karthik Dj: But when you do the math

Companies too
04/04/20, 11:44 pm - Karthik Dj: The trustees go home with the bulk of the money
04/04/20, 11:44 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah but this is different because

04/04/20, 11:45 pm - Karthik Dj: 2. They don't offer a service they get money from people wanting to be tight with dem god's

04/04/20, 11:46 pm - Karthik Dj: That's so fucked up
04/04/20, 11:47 pm - Somil Shah: There's something about Tirupati as well. They earn millions by selling the hair
04/04/20, 11:47 pm - Karthik Dj: Dude you ask the majority of people
04/04/20, 11:47 pm - Karthik Dj: You ask them why they pay
04/04/20, 11:47 pm - Karthik Dj: They will say "so that the temple can continue offering food to other people or to maintain the infrastructure"
04/04/20, 11:47 pm - Karthik Dj: But it's not even close to the truth
04/04/20, 11:47 pm - Karthik Dj: Yup
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Karthik Dj: Religion and healthcare are two places
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Somil Shah: Tonnes of money bro
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Karthik Dj: Where the supposed good guys fuck you in the ass when it comes to money
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Vishesh Dj: I think most people who go are the religious ones who just donate mindlessly
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Karthik Dj: Fair enough
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Vishesh Dj: Not necessarily for the charity work
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Karthik Dj: But then tax it at least
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Karthik Dj: No excuses for that
04/04/20, 11:48 pm - Karthik Dj: In fact you know what
04/04/20, 11:49 pm - Karthik Dj: I feel temples haven't done enough in this pandemic as well
04/04/20, 11:49 pm - Karthik Dj: dude South Indian temples have so much money
04/04/20, 11:49 pm - Karthik Dj: It's insane
04/04/20, 11:49 pm - Somil Shah: Charity organizations don't have to pay taxes na? That's a way of evading.
04/04/20, 11:49 pm - Somil Shah: I think temples come into the same criteria
04/04/20, 11:49 pm - Karthik Dj: And we shit on our billionaires cause they "didn't do enough"
04/04/20, 11:49 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah yeah

04/04/20, 11:50 pm - Somil Shah: Yup
04/04/20, 11:50 pm - Karthik Dj: And I am fed up of people raving about how temples do more good than harm
04/04/20, 11:50 pm - Somil Shah: Idk about "harm", but they hardly spend 10% of what they get
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Somil Shah: That's for sure
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Karthik Dj: 10%
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Karthik Dj: Bruv
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Karthik Dj: It's less than 0.0001 %
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Karthik Dj: Okay not harm
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Karthik Dj: But like
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Somil Shah: We don't know, the 1% must have their hands in this too
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Vishesh Dj: India mein Hindu temples are under government control so they do pay taxes
04/04/20, 11:51 pm - Karthik Dj: You gotta play by the same rules

19/04/20, 2:17 pm - Vishesh Dj: She had been complaining of jaw pain for some time toh tabhi doctor ko dikhane gaye
He said ki they’re not sure what it is but the scans showed something so immediate surgery is required
19/04/20, 2:18 pm - Vishesh Dj: Surgery kiya tumour nikala and it was sent for biopsy
19/04/20, 2:18 pm - Vishesh Dj: At that point they didn’t know what it was
19/04/20, 2:18 pm - Karthik Dj: Was it malignant?
19/04/20, 2:18 pm - Vishesh Dj: Biopsy results then said that it was a cancerous tumour
19/04/20, 2:19 pm - Karthik Dj: Fuck
19/04/20, 2:19 pm - Karthik Dj: Had it spread?
19/04/20, 2:19 pm - Vishesh Dj: And another surgery was required to remove the salivary gland which was where the tumour was

19/04/20, 2:20 pm - Vishesh Dj: After that radiation started for a month to kill all the cancer cells in that area
19/04/20, 2:20 pm - Vishesh Dj: Luckily it was diagnosed early on so it wasn’t life threatening
19/04/20, 2:20 pm - Karthik Dj: Fuck that's intense

19/04/20, 2:23 pm - Vishesh Dj: But the doctors said that there’s a very small chance that cancer recurs due to radiation
19/04/20, 2:23 pm - Karthik Dj: Puts things in perspective

19/04/20, 9:03 pm - Somil Shah: [19/04, 8:40 pm] Sohan Dj: Their economy just cannot stay low
[19/04, 8:40 pm] Sohan Dj: They are the world's superpower
[19/04, 8:40 pm] Sohan Dj: Tbh, USA thinks more about economy than lives of the people
And I don't find it that wrong
[19/04, 8:55 pm] Somil Shah: It's terribly wrong bro, kya yaar
[19/04, 8:55 pm] Somil Shah: Apne country mai aisa gaandu panti hua toh log pagal hojayge
[19/04, 8:56 pm] Somil Shah: The don't want it to. They want to retain their stand but they don't realize that the ones who keep the economy running, the people, will die
[19/04, 8:57 pm] Sohan Dj: It is
But they cannot lose their economy
[19/04, 8:57 pm] Sohan Dj: Logo kaa kaam hai marnaaa
[19/04, 8:57 pm] Sohan Dj: Okay shit just got dark
[19/04, 8:57 pm] Sohan Dj: Dude
[19/04, 8:58 pm] Somil Shah: Wtf, I don't get it. You basically want to risk your life but don't want your career to have a downfall
[19/04, 8:58 pm] Sohan Dj: The entire world wants to work in USA
They'll get replacements for every job every designation everywhere
[19/04, 9:00 pm] Somil Shah: Bro this is downright dark. If you were one of US's residents rn, teri gaand nai fati hoti. We can say this because we are sitting here, in a country where we have a sane PM who we believe will make things right
[19/04, 9:01 pm] Somil Shah: People are fucking afraid of their lives there. They can see that there's no one compassionate enough to think about the citizens
[19/04, 9:01 pm] Somil Shah: I feel too bad for them
[19/04, 9:02 pm] Somil Shah: And I would definitely not go to such a country, and thinking about living there? Nah bro, I'd rather live with a reduced wage in India
19/04/20, 9:04 pm - Somil Shah: Don't read it as Sohan, Somil. Read as two different opinions
19/04/20, 9:04 pm - Somil Shah: I really want to hear your thoughts on this
19/04/20, 9:05 pm - Vishesh Dj: Sohan downplays the value of life very easily bro😂
19/04/20, 9:06 pm - Vishesh Dj: Every time he’s like accha hua log mar rahe hai
19/04/20, 9:06 pm - Somil Shah: Arey even I'm like this when people who are terrible die
19/04/20, 9:07 pm - Somil Shah: But isko toh general log hi nai chaiye

[19/04, 9:07 pm] Sohan Dj: You won't even live to see 2120 (the next pandemic)

24/04/20, 12:11 am - Karthik Dj: Oh yeah
24/04/20, 12:11 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Oof
24/04/20, 12:11 am - Karthik Dj: He wants to remove lockdowns
24/04/20, 12:11 am - Somil Shah: I followed his recent tweets jisme aisa lagraha hai he wants the lockdown to lift up
24/04/20, 12:11 am - Karthik Dj: Which I don't agree
24/04/20, 12:11 am - Karthik Dj: I think his stats are flawed though
24/04/20, 12:11 am - Karthik Dj: Like look at this one
24/04/20, 12:12 am - Karthik Dj: <Media omitted>
24/04/20, 12:13 am - Somil Shah: Yeah i read this. Sometimes i feel it's difficult to wrap our head around his tweets
24/04/20, 12:14 am - Somil Shah: Explain the restricting wala paragraph na
24/04/20, 12:14 am - Karthik Dj: Basically if we manage to make sure only people under 45 get covid
24/04/20, 12:16 am - Somil Shah: Ah got it
24/04/20, 12:17 am - Somil Shah: So he's like let's take that 0.014% chance
24/04/20, 12:18 am - Vishesh Dj: Herd immunity ke chakkar mein so many will die
24/04/20, 12:18 am - Vishesh Dj: We can’t take that chance😂
24/04/20, 12:19 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Wo to hone wala hai
24/04/20, 12:19 am - Somil Shah: I think he's looking at the bigger picture
24/04/20, 12:19 am - Vaibhav Mewada: But apparently every life is precious😒
24/04/20, 12:19 am - Somil Shah: Controversial hai yeh opinion
24/04/20, 12:20 am - Vishesh Dj: If you value yours you shouldn’t ask others to risk theirs
24/04/20, 12:21 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Mai apna nahi bol raha

24/04/20, 12:22 am - Karthik Dj: What he is saying
24/04/20, 12:22 am - Somil Shah: Yeh sab ethical dilemma hai. And no wonder there are ethical boards to manage this shit
24/04/20, 12:22 am - Karthik Dj: Is take a lot of deaths now
24/04/20, 12:22 am - Karthik Dj: And get herd immunity later
24/04/20, 12:22 am - Karthik Dj: But...
24/04/20, 12:22 am - Karthik Dj: There is talk of reinfections
24/04/20, 12:22 am - Karthik Dj: Also
24/04/20, 12:22 am - Karthik Dj: Those death rates are all anecdotal
24/04/20, 12:22 am - Karthik Dj: Based on two months of evidence
24/04/20, 12:23 am - Karthik Dj: Can't expose large swaths of your population based on that
24/04/20, 12:23 am - Karthik Dj: So what we will see now
24/04/20, 12:23 am - Karthik Dj: Is that Sweden will be the poster child
24/04/20, 12:23 am - Karthik Dj: Cause they are going for herd immunity
24/04/20, 12:23 am - Somil Shah: Ohhhhh
24/04/20, 12:23 am - Karthik Dj: So in a few months we will know who is right and who is wrong
24/04/20, 12:24 am - Karthik Dj: As of right now they have more deaths than their neighbouring countries
24/04/20, 12:24 am - Karthik Dj: But long term let's see
24/04/20, 12:24 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Ek saal bada data analytics hoga proving media ne ye push kiya
24/04/20, 12:25 am - Vaibhav Mewada: To khatam
24/04/20, 12:25 am - Karthik Dj: So it's not just the media narrative
24/04/20, 12:26 am - Karthik Dj: Most epidemiologists have suggested this as well
24/04/20, 12:26 am - Karthik Dj: It's the safe option nothing else
24/04/20, 12:26 am - Vaibhav Mewada: You know what's safe though
24/04/20, 12:26 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Getting infected rn

24/04/20, 12:28 am - Vishesh Dj: And you might pass it on to someone else
24/04/20, 12:28 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Unka bhi fayda

24/04/20, 12:29 am - Karthik Dj: Arrey you aren't getting his point
24/04/20, 12:29 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Acha waise ha
24/04/20, 12:29 am - Vishesh Dj: Tujhe kuch nahi hoga matlab nahi every person you’ll be in contact with until you’re immune is safe from corona
24/04/20, 12:30 am - Somil Shah: Exactly and there's nowhere written ki once you're recovered you're immune from it
24/04/20, 12:30 am - Somil Shah: There are cases of Coronavirus reappearing

25/04/20, 10:50 pm - Karthik Dj: He is getting into conspiracy therapy
25/04/20, 10:50 pm - Karthik Dj: And a bit too right wing

26/04/20, 10:06 am - Somil Shah: Guys, y'all won't believe what I witnessed today in my dreams!!

So, we were in the US apparently. Everything has come down to utter chaos. People are running here and there, screaming and what not. It was definitely the Endgame.

So, now there's this loud speaker where everyone can hear Trump's voice ha. Trump is like, I have a very important decision to make, the final one...

Suddenly everyone starts to run to get cover. Even we run. Now we are sitting in this room with a window exactly in front of us. 

Trump goes off mic and one of the assistant comes up and says within a few seconds we will know what's up!

The scene is crazy. We are all looking at each other thinking whay will happen now. Full silence.

After a moment, I see something huge falling from the sky! It's the N Bomb! It's this huge thing with the US flag on it. 

Trump in the bg is like, Sorry folks that's the best decision I could make for y'all. 

I look behind at all of y'all with so many fucking emotions. Then I look at Mewada apparently and we both are probably in this thought ki We'll finally get to see what is life after death.

Suddenly everything vanishes, and I can feel it. Everything is wiping, I'm dying yeh woh. 

At the next moment, I experience absolute nothingness. Those 5 seconds were like the scariest. Like I won't define it as scary but fuck!
26/04/20, 10:10 am - Vaibhav Mewada: 😂😂😂😂😂😂
26/04/20, 10:10 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Too much of Joe Rogan

30/04/20, 11:16 am - Somil Shah: 5 saal? Bhenchod 6 months mai kya hoga kisse pata hai
30/04/20, 11:16 am - Somil Shah: Then too people compromise their present by investing into their future
30/04/20, 11:16 am - Somil Shah: Nai bhai, I mean ki if you have 10L currently, people tend to invest 9.5L in their future
30/04/20, 11:16 am - Somil Shah: And 50k se compromise mai jeete hai

30/04/20, 1:01 pm - Karthik Dj: No bro
30/04/20, 1:02 pm - Karthik Dj: Instead of looking at short term gratification
30/04/20, 1:02 pm - Karthik Dj: I would rather invest
30/04/20, 1:02 pm - Karthik Dj: And mutual funds are safe so why not
30/04/20, 1:23 pm - Vishesh Dj: Abhi tu paise ke saath karega kya
30/04/20, 1:26 pm - Somil Shah: Agreed but 5 years locking hota hai many of the times. And people have this mindset ki "Future ke liye rakhna hai sab". Like extra ho paise toh theek hai, but many people compromise luxuries of today so they can have a non existent better tomorrow
30/04/20, 1:38 pm - Karthik Dj: Naah I prefer that
30/04/20, 1:38 pm - Karthik Dj: Dude so naval ravikant
30/04/20, 1:38 pm - Karthik Dj: Got famous
30/04/20, 1:38 pm - Karthik Dj: Because of his how to get rich podcast
30/04/20, 1:38 pm - Karthik Dj: And he talks a lot about this in that
30/04/20, 1:39 pm - Somil Shah: He talks about building wealth, as a business
30/04/20, 1:39 pm - Somil Shah: Usme kaha usne Investment ka bola hai
30/04/20, 1:39 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah
30/04/20, 1:39 pm - Karthik Dj: But his premise
30/04/20, 1:39 pm - Karthik Dj: Is that you have to live below your means
30/04/20, 1:39 pm - Karthik Dj: And use that excess for investments
30/04/20, 1:40 pm - Karthik Dj: Wait lemme find that image
30/04/20, 1:40 pm - Somil Shah: He might be talking about Angel Investments
30/04/20, 1:42 pm - Karthik Dj: No no
30/04/20, 1:42 pm - Karthik Dj: It was about personal investments
30/04/20, 1:42 pm - Karthik Dj: I can't find the image
30/04/20, 1:42 pm - Karthik Dj: But the crux of it is
30/04/20, 1:42 pm - Karthik Dj: Its easy to get rich
30/04/20, 1:42 pm - Karthik Dj: If you live below your means
30/04/20, 1:42 pm - Karthik Dj: And shrewdly invest for long term gains
30/04/20, 1:44 pm - Somil Shah: I've never come across this
30/04/20, 1:45 pm - Somil Shah: Although he talks about "Happines and peace, which you can find in any point of time irrespective of your status, wealth."
30/04/20, 1:45 pm - Karthik Dj: Arrey there was an amazing graph
30/04/20, 1:45 pm - Karthik Dj: Dude so he starts off by saying
30/04/20, 1:46 pm - Karthik Dj: Money won't give you happiness
30/04/20, 1:46 pm - Karthik Dj: But financial freedom is necessary
30/04/20, 1:46 pm - Somil Shah: Yes
30/04/20, 1:47 pm - Somil Shah: The thing is, whatever these people call investments are completely self made, decide d investments. It involves a lot of risk but a lot of potential profit too. Mutual funds are just a safe play which gives you okay profit or no profit
30/04/20, 1:48 pm - Somil Shah: Idk if I'm right, but their investments and our investments are different topics
30/04/20, 1:48 pm - Vishesh Dj: But if you don’t have the knowledge then mutual funds is a decent option
30/04/20, 1:49 pm - Somil Shah: ++
30/04/20, 1:56 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah but they are good enough
30/04/20, 1:56 pm - Karthik Dj: For a lot of people

02/05/20, 4:21 pm - Somil Shah: regarding this

02/05/20, 4:24 pm - Vishesh Dj: Yes
02/05/20, 4:24 pm - Somil Shah: Arey bhai Naval also said the same thing
02/05/20, 4:24 pm - Vishesh Dj: He was kicked as Chairman for the 420 tweet
02/05/20, 4:24 pm - Somil Shah: Don't you think this might hold some weight
02/05/20, 4:25 pm - Vishesh Dj: Not just that bro
02/05/20, 4:25 pm - Vishesh Dj: Elon said ‘Tesla stock is too high imo”
02/05/20, 4:25 pm - Karthik Dj: Maybe
02/05/20, 4:25 pm - Karthik Dj: Like idk what to think
02/05/20, 4:25 pm - Somil Shah: Hahahahaha yes
02/05/20, 4:25 pm - Karthik Dj: The scientific word is clear though
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah yeah that's what I am talking about
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Somil Shah: Samee
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Karthik Dj: Which is why
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Karthik Dj: They might kick him
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Vishesh Dj: It does but you shouldn’t call the lockdown fascist and talk of freeing the people
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Vishesh Dj: Creates panic
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Vishesh Dj: Irresponsible af
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Karthik Dj: No but
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Karthik Dj: Let's say we are all wrong
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Karthik Dj: And the government is overblowing this
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Karthik Dj: And we don't need a lockdown
02/05/20, 4:26 pm - Somil Shah: He was never the politically and ethically correct one in terms of tweeting lol
02/05/20, 4:27 pm - Karthik Dj: A lockdown is also pretty bad for society
02/05/20, 4:27 pm - Karthik Dj: So maybe
02/05/20, 4:27 pm - Karthik Dj: It's not wrong
02/05/20, 4:27 pm - Karthik Dj: But
02/05/20, 4:27 pm - Karthik Dj: He needs more evidence
02/05/20, 4:27 pm - Karthik Dj: Or maybe we need more stats
02/05/20, 4:27 pm - Vishesh Dj: Lockdowns have helped keep the no of people infected and killed down
02/05/20, 4:28 pm - Vishesh Dj: Why would anyone want to risk that
02/05/20, 4:28 pm - Vishesh Dj: Abhi situation is improving
02/05/20, 4:28 pm - Vishesh Dj: But initially I think it was the right move
02/05/20, 4:30 pm - Karthik Dj: Okay so imma play devils advocatev
02/05/20, 4:30 pm - Karthik Dj: But like
02/05/20, 4:30 pm - Karthik Dj: What exactly are we slwoing down for
02/05/20, 4:30 pm - Karthik Dj: The numbers will always increase till we find a cure
02/05/20, 4:30 pm - Karthik Dj: So now we will be in lockdown for perpetuity
02/05/20, 4:31 pm - Karthik Dj: And also face an economic crisis
02/05/20, 4:33 pm - Vishesh Dj: People are recovering too
02/05/20, 4:33 pm - Vishesh Dj: If people are inside then it’s hardly gonna spread
02/05/20, 4:34 pm - Vishesh Dj: If it doesn’t spread potential deaths are prevented
02/05/20, 4:35 pm - Karthik Dj: No but my question isb
02/05/20, 4:35 pm - Karthik Dj: At this point
02/05/20, 4:35 pm - Karthik Dj: Can you contain it?
02/05/20, 4:35 pm - Karthik Dj: Like can you get to a point that there are zero cases in a country
02/05/20, 4:35 pm - Karthik Dj: That's impossible
02/05/20, 4:35 pm - Karthik Dj: So the threat of an outbreak is always looking
02/05/20, 4:38 pm - Vishesh Dj: I think it’s possible
02/05/20, 4:41 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: I am waiting for the first country to declare that they are corona free
02/05/20, 4:43 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah
02/05/20, 4:43 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: But ek cheej hai
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Karthik Dj: Seems super unlikely
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Karthik Dj: Okay I am talking about places
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Right now they say every life is valuable to we should have a lockdown
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Karthik Dj: Where there was an epidemic
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Karthik Dj: Like
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Karthik Dj: The Vatican doesn't count 😂
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Karthik Dj: So this is why I agree with this
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Karthik Dj: Let's say
02/05/20, 4:44 pm - Karthik Dj: Like let's agree with right wing conspiracies for a second
02/05/20, 4:45 pm - Karthik Dj: That the number of cases will be the same even without the lockdown
02/05/20, 4:45 pm - Karthik Dj: Still
02/05/20, 4:45 pm - Karthik Dj: The lockdown slows it down
02/05/20, 4:45 pm - Karthik Dj: Which doesn't cause an overload to our healthcare
02/05/20, 4:46 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: But once the lockdown is lifted no one gives a shit
02/05/20, 4:47 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: These corporates are donating thousands of dollars for the relief fund
02/05/20, 4:47 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: But they can't do anything about the employees
02/05/20, 4:47 pm - Vishesh Dj: It slows down the spread which means that the no of cases would have been much more without it
02/05/20, 4:47 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Suddenly so much care for the people
02/05/20, 4:48 pm - Karthik Dj: Fuck the corporations
02/05/20, 4:48 pm - Karthik Dj: They don't give a fuck

02/05/20, 4:52 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Infosys ka founder Narayan says lockdown ke baad bohot kaam karna hai to revive the economy
02/05/20, 4:52 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: And i think aisa hone bhi wala hai
02/05/20, 4:52 pm - Vishesh Dj: Hong Kong mein their legislative assembly has most of the seats reserved for businesses
02/05/20, 4:53 pm - Vishesh Dj: Though all of the people are pro democracy aka anti China these business representatives always vote for China ignoring the interests of the people
02/05/20, 4:55 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah yeah that's their hook
02/05/20, 4:56 pm - Karthik Dj: Honk Kong won't win the fight yo😂

06/05/20, 10:16 pm - Viral Dj: Dude so free thinkers..
I mean its a paradox within itself, Atleast in a philosophical sense.
If I ask you to be a free thinker, and you become a free thinker, you actually followed my ideological view point of free thinking afterall....
06/05/20, 10:16 pm - Viral Dj: Humans always resorted to someone to feed them ideas to view things, because thats the easier way out
06/05/20, 10:17 pm - Viral Dj: Before social media, it was politicians, before them, it was philosophers and before them it was religion
06/05/20, 10:17 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Ha but mai aise nahi dekhta isko

06/05/20, 10:20 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Vohi to paradox hai
06/05/20, 10:20 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: But waise ekdum paradox to nahi hai
06/05/20, 10:21 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: The ideas that you come up with are authentic
06/05/20, 10:24 pm - Viral Dj: Then you arent following a free thinking ideology, which makes you a biased person
But then you're refuting philosphies with your free will... which makes you a free thinker....
Paradox?

08/05/20, 6:07 pm - Somil Shah: "Cigerattes kill 500k a year, but y'all are okay with it. These are acceptable deaths"
08/05/20, 6:07 pm - Vishesh Dj: Yeh toh hai hi
08/05/20, 6:08 pm - Vishesh Dj: People are stupid
08/05/20, 6:09 pm - Vishesh Dj: Elon said 0 chance of this because he doesn’t have a neuralink but what if its a memory being played by his future self of a time before he got the device installed

08/05/20, 6:15 pm - Somil Shah: Usme galat kya hai
08/05/20, 6:15 pm - Karthik Dj: But still
08/05/20, 6:16 pm - Viral Dj: Imagine you paid full price for your phone. Now I tell you, I can unlock your processor to operate at 4GHz which it supported previously on a hardware level, but we didnt add it. So you gotta pay for enabling things which you already have..
08/05/20, 6:16 pm - Viral Dj: Abhi ek chote feature ka charge kiya
08/05/20, 6:16 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah but that's still capitalism na

08/05/20, 6:17 pm - Vishesh Dj: It’s sort of similar to that
08/05/20, 6:17 pm - Karthik Dj: Exactly
08/05/20, 6:17 pm - Somil Shah: You're playing the big game now. You need to get a new car even if you want a small fundamental upgrade, atleast a modification which costs mkney
08/05/20, 6:17 pm - Karthik Dj: I was thinking of apple
08/05/20, 6:17 pm - Karthik Dj: Their macbooks
08/05/20, 6:17 pm - Karthik Dj: Have so much customisation
08/05/20, 6:17 pm - Viral Dj: No so if you had the model S, it didnt ship with this feature, youd pay foe it with the app
08/05/20, 6:18 pm - Viral Dj: I have a neutral stance for this, I am not for it, but I can understand where it comes from
08/05/20, 6:18 pm - Karthik Dj: ++
08/05/20, 6:18 pm - Vishesh Dj: As long as it’s clear to the customer what they’re paying and what they can get by paying more I don’t see a problem
08/05/20, 6:18 pm - Karthik Dj: Like tbh
08/05/20, 6:18 pm - Karthik Dj: People can see through it
08/05/20, 6:19 pm - Karthik Dj: And it will affect the company in the long term

08/05/20, 6:19 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah it won't
08/05/20, 6:19 pm - Somil Shah: Yes they're earning through minor shifts in specs
08/05/20, 6:19 pm - Karthik Dj: But that's to do with the hype around it
08/05/20, 6:19 pm - Viral Dj: The only way I came to know about this because I was working for developing a similar system 😂
08/05/20, 6:19 pm - Karthik Dj: Which many would say I'd well earned 😂

09/05/20, 6:44 pm - Viral Dj: Dude I used to love karate, I was a year away from black belt back in tenth grade but eventually had to leave it due to injuries and a lot of money minded folks in the industry
09/05/20, 6:45 pm - Viral Dj: Ive dislocated my right elbow multiple times
09/05/20, 6:50 pm - Karthik Dj: Damn son

09/05/20, 6:51 pm - Viral Dj: Got**
09/05/20, 7:19 pm - Karthik Dj: Was it one accident or repeated blows?
09/05/20, 7:21 pm - Viral Dj: The first dislocation was because a guy larger than me thought itd be great to twist his feet around my arm and then try to put me down onthe ground.
Didnt end well, my elbow popped out of the socket
09/05/20, 7:21 pm - Karthik Dj: Wtf
09/05/20, 7:21 pm - Karthik Dj: Was it that or anal gone wrong 🌚
09/05/20, 7:23 pm - Viral Dj: Obviously after the relocation the tendons around the area were weak, I got back in the dojo after a month or so and during a session I got too pumped up and hit the opponent too hard, with my elbow.
Heres where the fuck up happens - I thought it was dislocated again this time (spoiler it wasnt) and the instructer tried putting back in place, that gave me a hairline crack
09/05/20, 7:23 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: 🙄
09/05/20, 7:24 pm - Viral Dj: Uske baad next year holi mei I had a plastic bag full of waterbaloons and some chuts thought itd be fun to take it away, so they ran and tried to grab it out my hand, one them wanked too hard and that again, dislocated my already weak elbow
09/05/20, 7:24 pm - Viral Dj: Had to quit everything then
09/05/20, 7:24 pm - Karthik Dj: Dafuq
09/05/20, 7:26 pm - Viral Dj: You got to hit the fucking elbow back, but then it was never dislocated in the first place, I might have just hit too hard and it was just hurting And I thoughtits dislocated
09/05/20, 7:26 pm - Viral Dj: Lol
09/05/20, 7:26 pm - Viral Dj: Gg
09/05/20, 7:26 pm - Viral Dj: Isleye even after joininggym, I prefer training strength over aesthetics

09/05/20, 7:32 pm - Viral Dj: Dude this friend of mine went from 90kgs (almost same height, same amount of muscle as me on his frame) to 67 kilos for nationals
09/05/20, 7:33 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: I didn't know this but there is a difference in training between bigger muscles and denser muscles
09/05/20, 7:33 pm - Viral Dj: Denser muscles ? Matlab?
09/05/20, 7:33 pm - Viral Dj: You mean a lower bodyfat?

09/05/20, 7:34 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah
09/05/20, 7:34 pm - Karthik Dj: It's basically aesthetic Vs power
09/05/20, 7:34 pm - Karthik Dj: Like all boxers
09/05/20, 7:34 pm - Karthik Dj: Have to stay lean but pack a punch
09/05/20, 7:34 pm - Karthik Dj: So they have "dense" muscles

09/05/20, 7:35 pm - Karthik Dj: It's basically fast twitch Vs slow twitch
09/05/20, 7:35 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: But he was bigger than mike tyson

09/05/20, 7:38 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: I need to try for myself after the lockdown is lifted
09/05/20, 7:39 pm - Viral Dj: Oh so you do need a shit ton of protien
09/05/20, 7:39 pm - Viral Dj: Vegetarian mei milna tough hai
09/05/20, 7:39 pm - Viral Dj: I rely on whey entirely
09/05/20, 7:39 pm - Viral Dj: If not meat Lena padta
09/05/20, 7:40 pm - Viral Dj: Generally the more restrictions you have on your diet you either
1. Spend more money for protien
2. Get less than enough protien

10/05/20, 7:45 pm - Viral Dj: Ferguson and khabib play in different weight classes na? Or the same one?
10/05/20, 7:45 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Na som

10/05/20, 7:48 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Mai ek mahine se sab padh raha hu
10/05/20, 7:48 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Kaafi interesting hai
10/05/20, 7:48 pm - Viral Dj: Accha
10/05/20, 7:48 pm - Viral Dj: I am still getting used to the meta
10/05/20, 7:48 pm - Viral Dj: Roz 3-4 matches dekh raha hu
10/05/20, 7:49 pm - Viral Dj: Khabib is fucking lit
10/05/20, 7:49 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Vo bohot religious hai
10/05/20, 7:49 pm - Viral Dj: Accha?
10/05/20, 7:49 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Khabib vs Mcgregor live dekha tha mai
10/05/20, 7:49 pm - Viral Dj: I dont know all that, but his playing staying style
10/05/20, 7:49 pm - Viral Dj: is fuckingamazing
10/05/20, 7:50 pm - Viral Dj: Dekhna padega
10/05/20, 7:50 pm - Viral Dj: I saw his debut fight at age 23
10/05/20, 7:51 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: McGregor ka documentary dekha mai last week hi
10/05/20, 7:51 pm - Viral Dj: I sometimes wonder, what if these guys go against a thor/eddie hall
10/05/20, 7:52 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Ye log jitenge
10/05/20, 7:52 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Dude best of knockouts dekh
10/05/20, 7:52 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Ek padti hai sidha ground pe
10/05/20, 7:52 pm - Viral Dj: Eddie/thor are over 6 feet tall and weight over 120-130 kilos
10/05/20, 7:53 pm - Viral Dj: Thor is the current worlds strongest man aise
10/05/20, 7:53 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: That's weightlifting yes
10/05/20, 7:53 pm - Viral Dj: And like powerlifting, is all about explosive power output for a short duration
10/05/20, 7:53 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: But punch marne mai speed mai these guys win pakka
10/05/20, 7:53 pm - Viral Dj: So like their push muscles primarily are fucking strong
10/05/20, 7:54 pm - Viral Dj: And a big layer of fat around organs
10/05/20, 7:54 pm - Viral Dj: Haaaa
10/05/20, 7:54 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Weightlifting mai mma wale nowhere close to the powerlifters
10/05/20, 7:54 pm - Viral Dj: No no I am talking about pure fighting
10/05/20, 7:54 pm - Viral Dj: Like not MMA wala either
10/05/20, 7:54 pm - Viral Dj: just a pure brawl
10/05/20, 7:55 pm - Viral Dj: Last man standing
10/05/20, 7:55 pm - Viral Dj: In grappling too, if they get a hold of you on the ground, by their sheer weight, movement would be so tough
10/05/20, 7:55 pm - Viral Dj: And thor I know for a fact does boxing too
10/05/20, 7:56 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Ha vo to hai
10/05/20, 7:56 pm - Viral Dj: He broke eddie halls record recently, by deadlifting half a ton
10/05/20, 7:56 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: That's the reason we have divisions based on weight
10/05/20, 7:56 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Ha padha
10/05/20, 7:56 pm - Viral Dj: And eddie vs thor ka match hone wala hai
10/05/20, 7:56 pm - Viral Dj: Damn son half a fucking ton
10/05/20, 7:57 pm - Viral Dj: Do you guys wonder if it were to be you vs some black belt in karate, would you be able to kick their ass?
10/05/20, 7:58 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Ye group se sirf tere aur shaurya ka chance hai
10/05/20, 7:59 pm - Viral Dj: Idk man I think about that sometimes
10/05/20, 8:00 pm - Viral Dj: That guy I used to spar with? He got into a fight at the gym, just one punch thrown by both parties, and he almost knocked the other dude out with a single punch. Both were equally well built
10/05/20, 8:00 pm - Viral Dj: The other guy was infact on roids too (speculation from my end, but 99% true hai)
10/05/20, 8:01 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Waise jinen bhi mar sakta hai
10/05/20, 8:01 pm - Viral Dj: Ha usne mara tha, mussorie mei
10/05/20, 8:01 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Phone chori hua tha na
10/05/20, 8:02 pm - Viral Dj: some guy stole his phone and tried to run, fucking punched that dude so hard his knuckles started bleeding
10/05/20, 8:02 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: r/instantregret
10/05/20, 8:02 pm - Viral Dj: lolll
10/05/20, 8:02 pm - Karthik Dj: In the same weight class UFC fighters win easily
10/05/20, 8:02 pm - Viral Dj: Yes obvv
10/05/20, 8:02 pm - Viral Dj: Powerlifters dude much much higher than even the heavyweight weight class at UFC
10/05/20, 8:03 pm - Karthik Dj: Heavyweights of ufc will wreck powerlifters though
10/05/20, 8:03 pm - Karthik Dj: It's one thing having crazy strength
10/05/20, 8:03 pm - Viral Dj: And much taller (generally) and they have a grip of gods. Imagine the amount shear strength you'd need to have to hold onto half a ton at least 5 feet above the ground
10/05/20, 8:03 pm - Karthik Dj: But these guys know positioning and leverage
10/05/20, 8:03 pm - Karthik Dj: It's the knowledge aspect of it
10/05/20, 8:04 pm - Karthik Dj: Especially his jitsu
10/05/20, 8:04 pm - Karthik Dj: *jiu
10/05/20, 8:04 pm - Viral Dj: Yep yep ye toh hai
but most powerlifters also box, so thats something to look out for
10/05/20, 8:04 pm - Viral Dj: Like the top level ones
10/05/20, 8:04 pm - Karthik Dj: Naah but still
10/05/20, 8:04 pm - Karthik Dj: Boxers have fared very very poorly in the UFC
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Karthik Dj: So the thing is
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Karthik Dj: When the idc started
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Karthik Dj: *UFC
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Karthik Dj: It was still very experimental
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Viral Dj: So essentially, if they luck out and get one full strength shot at the UFC guy, it'd be a knockout for sure. But given the agility these folks have, I don't think they'd be able to land a single clean shot
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Karthik Dj: So you had a lot of different types of people participating
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Viral Dj: And these folks (powerlifters) run out of gas in no time
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Karthik Dj: But over the years there's been a meta
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Viral Dj: of?
10/05/20, 8:05 pm - Karthik Dj: And it's wrestlers and jiu jitsu
10/05/20, 8:06 pm - Karthik Dj: Jiu jitsu was the original meta
10/05/20, 8:06 pm - Viral Dj: Oh yeah
10/05/20, 8:06 pm - Karthik Dj: But now wrestlers have been dominating
10/05/20, 8:06 pm - Karthik Dj: So you had people like chuck Liddell
10/05/20, 8:06 pm - Viral Dj: Jiu jitsu is the jam man
10/05/20, 8:06 pm - Karthik Dj: Who would just punch the daylights out of you
10/05/20, 8:06 pm - Karthik Dj: But it's not the same
10/05/20, 8:06 pm - Karthik Dj: Also the thing is
10/05/20, 8:07 pm - Karthik Dj: The level of competition in the UFC
10/05/20, 8:07 pm - Karthik Dj: Is way too high now
10/05/20, 8:07 pm - Viral Dj: Now that I look back at the karate days, I feel karate, atleast the version that is taught across India is for plebs. Not even kidding.
10/05/20, 8:07 pm - Viral Dj: oh for sure
10/05/20, 8:08 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Viral tune karate khudse chalu kiya ya kisine bola isliye
10/05/20, 8:08 pm - Viral Dj: Khudse
10/05/20, 8:08 pm - Viral Dj: Bohot khela
10/05/20, 8:09 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah yeah
10/05/20, 8:09 pm - Karthik Dj: Karate got famous
10/05/20, 8:09 pm - Karthik Dj: But the thing is
10/05/20, 8:09 pm - Viral Dj: I used to be bullied (physically) in my school. So like by 7th grade I had made up mind ki kuch karna hai (plus young blood)
10/05/20, 8:09 pm - Karthik Dj: At the elite level karate light not be as effective as jiu jitsu
10/05/20, 8:09 pm - Karthik Dj: But normally
10/05/20, 8:09 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Oh new layer revealed
10/05/20, 8:10 pm - Karthik Dj: If you know your karate you are still better than most people out there
10/05/20, 8:10 pm - Karthik Dj: To handle confrontation
10/05/20, 8:10 pm - Karthik Dj: And that's what matters
10/05/20, 8:11 pm - Viral Dj: No so @918689955742 there are so many forms of karate (I used to do Okinawan) and that's like the MMA of karate, in the pure sense it a combination of taekwondo, judo and pure karate - but these folks here are so money minded that you get upgrades based on the money you spend on camps - if you don't attend a national camp you don't get primary upgrades (till brown 2)
and if you don't attend international ones, you don't get secondary upgrades (brown 3 to black and advanced)
10/05/20, 8:12 pm - Viral Dj: Oh there's more to it -  most of them were from a particular community. My school was essentially that community (48%), 51% Christians and 1% hindus lol
And plus not in an affluent neighbourhood either, so brawls would be quite common
10/05/20, 8:13 pm - Viral Dj: yeppp
10/05/20, 8:14 pm - Viral Dj: But like if you consider a decently strong dude vs some guy who got a black belt from these local dojos here, the fight would be even
10/05/20, 8:15 pm - Viral Dj: These guys are trained so so so much for just pure agility & throwing raw power output is frowned upon in actually kumite (fights). You get warnings if you hit your opponent too hard
10/05/20, 8:16 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: Fuck mai sochne lag gaya hu job ke baad ye sab karne ka time milega?
10/05/20, 8:17 pm - Viral Dj: bc
10/05/20, 8:17 pm - Viral Dj: sab milega time
10/05/20, 8:17 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: It would be fun just to explore it
10/05/20, 8:19 pm - Viral Dj: explore what
10/05/20, 8:20 pm - Vaibhav Mewada: MMA
10/05/20, 8:21 pm - Viral Dj: Oh yeah dude I totally wish to do it
10/05/20, 8:21 pm - Viral Dj: I am just interested to see how much of this raw powerlifting strength translates to fighting
10/05/20, 8:22 pm - Shaurya: It will be good
10/05/20, 8:22 pm - Shaurya: But bulk might slow your speed
10/05/20, 8:22 pm - Shaurya: If you haven't been maintaining agility
10/05/20, 8:23 pm - Shaurya: But strength wise toh 👌🏻
10/05/20, 8:24 pm - Viral Dj: yeah that's what I feel - single punch power outputs would be high but given the fact that I have to get to a much higher overall weight to get my strength high (around 88-89 kilos), damn I don't think I'd be able to just do foot work for more than 5-8 minutes lol
10/05/20, 8:25 pm - Shaurya: You dont need 8 minutes if you finish him in 1😉
10/05/20, 8:25 pm - Viral Dj: HBwahhahahahah
10/05/20, 8:25 pm - Shaurya: Tu toh kar bhi dega
10/05/20, 8:26 pm - Shaurya: What are the explosive workouts these guys do ? Any idea ?
10/05/20, 8:26 pm - Viral Dj: Nah dude, sparring kiya hai voh friend ke sath - he wreaks the fuck out of me. (essentially, same height, same muscle, about the same strength for lifts at the gym but he plays boxing at a national level lol)
10/05/20, 8:27 pm - Viral Dj: Idk about these guys but that friend of mine does 5x5, explosive
Like say he is benching, he'd put slightly lower weight than his 5 rep max but then he'd just fucking ram the bar off his chest at full strength
10/05/20, 8:28 pm - Shaurya: Yeah that
10/05/20, 8:28 pm - Shaurya: Really improves their punches etc
10/05/20, 8:29 pm - Viral Dj: But then it depends from person to person
His mama is at a very high level at Mumbai police and he comes to the same gym as us, he just avoids heavy shit altogether before 12 weeks of fighting
10/05/20, 8:29 pm - Viral Dj: His philosophy is thoda old school, he just works on his cardio
10/05/20, 8:30 pm - Shaurya: Quite a few aspects to look at then ?
10/05/20, 8:30 pm - Viral Dj: yeahh - it all depends on how you fight I feel
10/05/20, 8:30 pm - Viral Dj: that friend of mine, fights super defensive, thoda opportunist jaise
His mama fights aggressive
10/05/20, 8:31 pm - Viral Dj: You guys ever fought as a kid?
10/05/20, 8:32 pm - Karthik Dj: Nope
10/05/20, 8:32 pm - Karthik Dj: I did taekwondo for a few years
10/05/20, 8:32 pm - Karthik Dj: But that's about it
10/05/20, 8:32 pm - Viral Dj: WTF? never?
10/05/20, 8:32 pm - Viral Dj: Like school mei brawl or something
10/05/20, 8:33 pm - Karthik Dj: I mean when I was 5 or 6
10/05/20, 8:33 pm - Karthik Dj: Naah
10/05/20, 8:36 pm - Viral Dj: Ahh
10/05/20, 8:36 pm - Viral Dj: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aaehn1aY8Ig
They did fight, but ffs it was for fun
10/05/20, 8:36 pm - Viral Dj: None of them were actually fighting fighting aise
10/05/20, 8:36 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah I have seen this
10/05/20, 8:36 pm - Karthik Dj: But Conor would lose obviously
10/05/20, 8:36 pm - Karthik Dj: The weight difference
10/05/20, 8:36 pm - Viral Dj: Yeah dude if thor actually started picking him up
10/05/20, 8:37 pm - Karthik Dj: Yeah and grappling is out of question
10/05/20, 8:37 pm - Viral Dj: yeppp
11/05/20, 6:43 am - Viral Dj: https://youtu.be/Ny2gB7JeJFQ
11/05/20, 6:43 am - Viral Dj: Dude respect for tony++
11/05/20, 10:59 am - Viral Dj: https://youtu.be/pwaWilO_Pig
Time ho toh dekhna
11/05/20, 11:03 am - Karthik Dj: It's my favourite podcast
11/05/20, 11:03 am - Karthik Dj: This guy was gold
11/05/20, 11:03 am - Viral Dj: Totally dude
11/05/20, 11:04 am - Viral Dj: Imma start napping now
11/05/20, 11:04 am - Karthik Dj: Dude that podcast
11/05/20, 11:04 am - Karthik Dj: Has to be the most consequential podcast for me
11/05/20, 11:05 am - Karthik Dj: Eye opening stuff
11/05/20, 11:05 am - Karthik Dj: I knew you would like him
11/05/20, 11:06 am - Viral Dj: Dude so idk if you guys are into Upanishads and shit but like I was reading one of them sometime back and they talked about how we live in three states, awake, dreaming and then Deep sleep state and it basically drew our entire conciousness around these three states of being
11/05/20, 11:06 am - Viral Dj: Bohot Baap tha
11/05/20, 11:06 am - Viral Dj: Loved him
11/05/20, 11:06 am - Viral Dj: I started taking magnesium glyciante  sometime back and hands down thats the best investment I've made for slee
11/05/20, 11:07 am - Viral Dj: My deep sleep went from around 20ish percentto 45-50%
11/05/20, 11:07 am - Karthik Dj: Where did you get it from?
11/05/20, 11:07 am - Viral Dj: I tried a couple of Amazon sellers
11/05/20, 11:07 am - Viral Dj: Then settled onto one of them
11/05/20, 11:08 am - Viral Dj: Healthyhey name hai
11/05/20, 11:08 am - Viral Dj: I recommended it to Milind as he has similar issues with sleep and he absolutely loved it
11/05/20, 11:09 am - Viral Dj: And its better than most notoropics too. I tried something called as bacopa (alcohol based solution) and it knocks you out in like an hour but tthen has side effects on mood
11/05/20, 11:10 am - Viral Dj: Magnesium mei aisa kuch nahi hota
11/05/20, 11:11 am - Viral Dj: Ive like a pura app based setup for sleep monitoring
If you guys have a decent smart band, I would highly recommend purchasing sleep as android
11/05/20, 11:11 am - Viral Dj: It has this function where it wakes you up in light stages of your sleep. You never ever wake up groggy
11/05/20, 11:13 am - Viral Dj: <Media omitted>
11/05/20, 11:15 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Haan ye dekha hai
11/05/20, 11:15 am - Vaibhav Mewada: 10-12 ke beech mai sleep is worth 4 hours
11/05/20, 11:16 am - Vaibhav Mewada: Isliye villages mai logo itne healthy hote hai
11/05/20, 11:50 am - Viral Dj: Yep
11/05/20, 12:42 pm - Shaurya: pm ?
12/05/20, 3:04 am - Somil Shah: <Media omitted>
